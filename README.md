# About
A ready to use ExpressJs server template with a Postgres database. This backend server can be used to add a database to any application, making the production of fullstack apps more straight forward and less time consuming. Setting it up is easy due to great documentation and thorough testing.

##Dependencies

- chalk: ^2.4.2
- dotenv: ^2.0.0
- ejs: ^3.1.9

## Create the DB

2. Create a role and database: from your terminal run the command `psql` then `CREATE ROLE labber LOGIN PASSWORD 'labber';` then `CREATE DATABASE template_db WITH OWNER = labber;`. If you want to use a deferent name for your database go to the file .env and change the database to whatever you like. Also in the .env file you can change the postgreSQL password to match what your postgreSQL is currently, as well as the postgreSQL user name.

## Setup
